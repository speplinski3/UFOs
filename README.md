# Using Javascript & HTML To Create a Dynamic Table & Webpage: The Truth is Out There

## Purpose: 
The purpose of this project was to create a webpage that allowed users to filter a dynamic data table featuring UFO sightings by specific criteria.
By using `Javascript, HTML, Bootstrap and CSS`, users can filter their search results by multiple criteria on a webpage that is intuitive, descriptive, and easy on the eyes.

## Demonstration:
To use the search function, the user can enter a filter they decide on on the far left. The available criteria are: **Date, City, State, Country, and UFO Shape.**

The user can decide how many filters they'd like to use. One or multiple filters can be used.

(Filtering single criteria.)

(Filtering on all criteria levels.)

## Summary & Suggestions:
Overall, the site is functional and overall easy to use. However, there could be some improvements. First of all, the filter is sensitive to capitalization, meaning that if a user for instance typed "San Diego" instead of the all-lowercase "san diego" in the dataset, the user would not get a desired result and no data would populate.

The website could also use additional filters to search by duration of UFO sighting as well as include a feature to search within comments for certain keywords. 
An additional improvement could be adding a Top Navigation Bar featuring a Home Page, About Us, and a page for the dynamic table. This might make for a cleaner appearance and ability to add any additional information such as "latest sighting" or map-based visualizations of UFOs in certain areas.
